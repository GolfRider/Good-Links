### Decision Fatigue
    1. http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/magazine/do-you-suffer-from-decision-fatigue.html (Great Read)
    Some Points:
    -------------
     a. Having too many choices exhausts the mind, which can strongly impact your final decision
     b. Make important decisions early in the day, not later 
     c. Eliminate unnecessary choices
     d. Spend your mental energy on Important matters that actually ipmact your career/personal life
     e. Don't be in a indecisive state for long time, it will result in frustration
     f. One of the reason for decision fatigue is the fear of giving up on options.
     g. Going to buffet,shopping mall often results in decision-fatigue
     h. Zuckerberg,Jobs often wear/wore the same attire for their day job, 
        because they don't want to spend their mental energy on it.
     i. It can affect our productivity, and can impact us emotionally,so we should be VERY mindful of that.

### Functional Programming
    http://blog.reactandbethankful.com/posts/2015/09/15/understanding-the-functional-revolution/
     
### Software Design
    Simplicity -- the design must be simple, both in implementation and interface. 
                  It is more important for the implementation to be  
                  simple than the interface. Simplicity is the most important consideration in a design.
    Correctness -- the design must be correct in all observable aspects. It is slightly better to be simple than correct.
    Consistency -- the design must not be overly inconsistent. Consistency can be sacrificed for simplicity in some cases, 
                    but it is better to drop those parts of the design that deal with less common circumstances 
                    than to introduce either implementational complexity or inconsistency.
    Completeness -- the design must cover as many important situations as is practical. 
                    All reasonably expected cases should be covered. 
                    Completeness can be sacrificed in favor of any other quality. 
                    In fact, completeness must be sacrificed whenever implementation simplicity is jeopardized. 
                    Consistency can be sacrificed to achieve completeness if simplicity is retained; especially worthless is     
                    consistency of interface.

### Abstractions (Rigid vs Fluid)
    https://dzone.com/articles/abstraction-considered-harmful [Good One]
    Sometimes Abstractions can be leaky when the underlying problem is sufficiently complex.
    In such cases, our abstractions have to be fluid rather than being static.
    
    0. "The purpose of abstracting is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise." - E Dijkstra

    1. The key takeaway is that abstractions leak, and we have to deal with that. 
    	There is never a silver bullet for problems of             sufficient complexity.

    2. [Let’s] not make concrete, static abstractions. Trust ourselves to let ourselves peer below the facade. 
       There’s a lot of complexity down there, but we need to engage with that complexity. 
	We need tools that help us engage with the complexity, not a fire blanket. 
	Abstractions are going to leak, so make the abstractions fluid.
	
    3. Abstraction, in and of itself, is not harmful. On the contrary, it’s necessary for progress. 
        What’s harmful is relying on impenetrable barriers to protect our precious programmers from hard problems. 
        After all, the 21st-century engineer understands that in order to play in the sand, 
        we all need to be comfortable getting our feet a little wet from time to time.
   
    4. “Abstraction is sometimes harmful”
    5. Duplication is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction. 
	Just deciding which little details we need to expose on our abstractions
	can be difficult, particularly when we don’t know how they will be used. 
    6. The programmer complains that there’s not enough abstraction for a hard sub-problem. 
    	Indeed, the programmer doesn’t care about solving the sub-problem. 
    	They are focused on solving the greater problem at hand. 
    	So, as any good programmer would do, we build an abstraction for the hard sub-problem, mask its inner workings, 
    	and expose what we think is necessary for interacting with it. 
	7. But then we discover that the abstraction leaks and complain that it isn’t perfect. 
	8.It turns out, hard problems are hard. The programmer then simply does away 
   	with the abstraction and solves the sub-problem for their specific case, handling the 
 	complexity in a way that makes sense for their application.

### Simple Programming & Why it matters
	1. https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-single-biggest-mistake-programmers-make-every-day-62366b432308 
	[ Read the above link, pretty awesome]
	Simplify your code. Start with the least complicated implementation and 
	work your way toward more complex solutions only when 	the problem demands it.
	
	Remember:
	a. Keep It Stupid Simple (KISS)
	b. Make it work, make it right, make it fast.
	c. Understand the problem. (Know what “make it work” means.)
	d. Begin at the beginning.
	e. Start with tests.
	f. Do One Thing (DOT).
	g. Start small and iterate.
	h. Pure function > Function > Factory > Class
	i. Simple beats clever every day of the week.

### Googler's approach to Time Management
	1. Divide your time/work into 4 quadrants
	2. Saying NO is necessary , when you think your time could be spent better elsewhere
	3. You should feel , you are doing something meaningful
	4. Be in a driver's seat of atleast one thing - no matter how small/official/un-official it could be
	5. It makes you feel good, which is very important
	6. Think the big picture
	7. DESIGN your time, not just MANAGE it..!!
	8. TIME IS LIMITED, YOU CAN"T DO EVERYTHING IN A DAY'S TIME
	9. http://www.fastcompany.com/3057847/how-to-be-a-success-at-everything/this-googler-explains-how-to-design-your-time-rather-than-
	10. One popular way to map out a plan (STRATEGIC) is by using the acronym SMART:

		Specific: Write down exactly what you want to achieve.
		Measurable: How are you going to assess when you’re done? Make sure you define it.
		Achievable: Is this doable? What do you need in place to get this done?
		Realistic: Be pragmatic. How can you actually make this happen? What might stand in your way? 
		How can you avoid and/or bounce back from potential pitfalls?
		Timeline: Will this task take an hour or a month? Set aside the time you’ll need, and protect it.

### Planning Efectively
	1. Hapiness is Success , Hapiness is a journey, not a destination.
	2. Hapinesss can have great impact on one's career & Productivity
	3. Plan for reality, not fantasy : plan for only now, everything in the future is going to change 
	4. & it is not worth our time
	5. Don't fall in love with the plan
	6. Reduce the number of varibles , so it reduces your confusion
	7. Success is measured by your happiness not by your accomplishments
	8. Above all,Keep things simple

### Rejection Therapy
	1. http://rejectiontherapy.com/  ["Rejection is success with Rejection Therapy"]
	2. "When you get rejection, it’s a call to action. It’s a piece of positive feedback that says you’re not ready just yet, but someday you might be. Someday you could be. Someday…you will be. " - [http://jonwestenberg.com/new-blog/]

### Promises / Functional Approach
	“So we’ve created a correct optimizing module loader with barely any code, simply by using a graph of lazy promises. 
	We’ve taken the functional programming approach of using value relationships rather than explicit control flow 
	to solve the problem, and it was much easier than if we’d written the control flow ourselves as the main element 
	in the solution.”
	— Callbacks are Imperative, Promises are Functional by @jcoglan

### Leadership & It Future
	1. Whole Life Leadership works from the mental model that we are all leaders in all areas of our lives, title or not.
	2. We have to be clear on our vision, our purpose and our values.
	3. Vision: 
		Our Vision acts as our North Star. It guides us and answers the question of, 
		“what am I out to accomplish?”
	4. Purpose: 
		Our purpose or mission is our driver and our motivation. 
		It answers the key question, “why do I want to do this?”
	5. Values: 
		Our values are like our compass and they help us answer the questions like, 
		“is this aligned with what is important to me?”
	6. We have the ability within us to be leaders in every aspect of our lives.
	7. Side notes from another blog:
		1. It is all about being DOERS
		2. If experts say, it is impossible, it is time to get a different expert.
		3. New is not necessarily better, but it always provides opportunity
	8. We all have to be leaders at work, home & with friends

### Motivation - Do we really need it ?
	1. "Who says you need to wait until you ‘feel like’ doing something in order to start doing it? 
	   The problem, from this perspective, isn’t that you don’t feel motivated; 
	   it’s that you imagine you need to feel motivated. … If you can regard your thoughts 
	   and emotions about whatever you’re  procrastinating on as passing weather, you’ll realise that your reluctance 
	   about working isn’t something that needs to be eradicated or transformed into positivity. 
	   You can coexist with it. You can note the procrastinatory feelings and work anyway."

### Resuability Myth
	1. https://dzone.com/articles/the-write-once-reuse-many-times-myth
	2. "You won’t write once – especially if your team lacks hard-won experience to 
	    create high-quality abstractions. Embrace the idea that you will write something 
	    multiple times – not because it is desirable, more because it is inevitable. 
	    Deliver value to your business iteratively and deepen your understanding of both the 
	    problem and solution spaces. 
	    You will be pleasantly surprised with the results. Remember, pursuing reuse 
	    without continuous value is the wrong goal."
