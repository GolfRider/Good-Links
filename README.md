### Decision Fatigue
    1. http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/magazine/do-you-suffer-from-decision-fatigue.html (Great Read)
    Some Points:
    -------------
     a. Having too many choices exhausts the mind, which can strongly impact your final decision
     b. Make important decisions early in the day, not later 
     c. Eliminate unnecessary choices
     d. Spend your mental energy on Important matters that actually ipmact your career/personal life
     e. Don't be in a indecisive state for long time, it will result in frustration
     f. One of the reason for decision fatigue is the fear of giving up on options.
     g. Going to buffet,shopping mall often results in decision-fatigue
     h. Zuckerberg,Jobs often wear/wore the same attire for their day job, 
        because they don't want to spend their mental energy on it.
     i. It can affect our productivity, and can impact us emotionally,so we should be VERY mindful of that.

    Quoting from above:
    "You need to see lessons where you see barriers."
    "Sometimes we're not yet the people we need to be in order to contain the desires we have. 
     Sometimes we have to let ourselves evolve into the place where we can allow what we want to transpire."

### Functional Programming
    http://blog.reactandbethankful.com/posts/2015/09/15/understanding-the-functional-revolution/
     
### Software Design
    Simplicity -- the design must be simple, both in implementation and interface. 
                  It is more important for the implementation to be  
                  simple than the interface. Simplicity is the most important consideration in a design.
    Correctness -- the design must be correct in all observable aspects. It is slightly better to be simple than correct.
    Consistency -- the design must not be overly inconsistent. Consistency can be sacrificed for simplicity in some cases, 
                    but it is better to drop those parts of the design that deal with less common circumstances 
                    than to introduce either implementational complexity or inconsistency.
    Completeness -- the design must cover as many important situations as is practical. 
                    All reasonably expected cases should be covered. 
                    Completeness can be sacrificed in favor of any other quality. 
                    In fact, completeness must be sacrificed whenever implementation simplicity is jeopardized. 
                    Consistency can be sacrificed to achieve completeness if simplicity is retained; especially worthless is     
                    consistency of interface.
